        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Arnav Singh, a final year undergraduate at IIIT Delhi, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and currently looking for opportunities to grow. I have previously worked as an intern in the Strategic Information Systems department at Indian Oil and as a software developer in the Algorithms to Architecture Lab at IIIT Delhi under Prof. Sumit Darak, where I built an online portal for students to remotely access electronic equipment in university labs. I also have experience in social sciences and humanities, having been an undergraduate researcher under Prof. Manohar Kumar, studying vigilantism as a political phenomenon and its digital manifestations.</p>
